# NinetailsX Graphics Engine

The NinetailsX is a hobbyist graphics engine built from the ground up using C/C++. Everything
written (with some exceptions) from scratch, only utilizing libraries when it is absolutely necessary.

### Development Requirements

Windows/Linux, CMake, and a compiler which can compile C++17 is necessary for a near headache-less experience.

## Recreation of the the Legend of Zelda Oracle Titles

In an effort to guide my development and to challenge myself, I have chosen to recreate
the Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Season Game Boy Color in C++. Below are some of the ideas
that I have for this course of action:

- <h3>Maintained Look & Feel</h3>

	I want to preserve the look and feel of the original games because I feel they are
	timeless classics that deserve the respect of keeping their classic look.

- <h3>Combine Seasons & Ages</h3>

	The origin Seasons and Ages games are tied together, though its difficult to say
	which title comes first in terms of linear progression. Nonetheless, combining
	these titles together to make one cohesive game is most certainly possible given
	the near endless resources modern hardware allows.

- <h3>Expanded World</h3>

	Bouncing off the previous point, this means that I can expand the world and add
	new areas. This will be rather difficult to implement without introducing new
	resources into the mix, but if this project matures enough, I want to include new
	areas so that this game is not simply a clone of the original titles, but
	something new and refreshing.

**Important** to note that any assets I use for this project will not be publicly accessable
due to copyright law. Any assets I use in my testing are ones that I have sourced myself and
made private for personal use. You may source your own assets for your own personal use.
